### About me
My name is Michael. I am an open, sincere and creative person and I easily make contact. I have an active life position and I always strive to learn something new for myself. My first computer appeared in my youth and then I began to actively learn about it. But all this continued at the level of a hobby. At that time, I did not think that in the future I would want to associate my professional activity ith a computer. At the moment, my goal is to become a front-end developer. And I intend to move towards my goal no matter what.
